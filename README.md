For this part i have add better dishes and i have add in a picker to make its more user friendly. 
by adding the picker it makes my app look more profesional and it adds more class to the app 
I also had to add and index.tsx and a types.tsx to my code. 
I also added a keyboard and a number keyboard so the user can add their own dishes as well as the chef.
I installed npm install @react-native-picker/picker
npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
npx pod-install ios

These help the code Look and operate more smooth. 
Also allows both android and ios users to download it onto their devices 

For the final part I have added in more pickers and used coaded words to help me with my styles for each screen. 
The different codes for the stlyes made it easier for me to follow the code and made the code more efficient. 
I also updated the picker styling as you can see from my part 2 and part 3 , it is different. 
This gives the app a more mordern and stylish look too it. 
I have also added in a calculating methord so that the users and the chef can see the average for their courses. 
I have added in flatlists to the code and an array too tie everything together.
