For this part i have add better dishes and i have add in a picker to make its more user friendly. 
by adding the picker it makes my app look more profesional and it adds more class to the app 
I also had to add and index.tsx and a types.tsx to my code. 
I also added a keyboard and a number keyboard so the user can add their own dishes as well as the chef.
I installed npm install @react-native-picker/picker
npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
npx pod-install ios

These help the code Look and operate more smooth. 
Also allows both android and ios users to download it onto their devices
